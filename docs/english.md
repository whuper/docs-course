## 介词和连词的区别

英语**介词**（`preposition`）后接名词或名词词组

> I like the shirt in blue

英语**连词**（`conjunction`）后是接一个完整的句子

> I like playing vedio games ，but I like playing basketball more.


## 定语从句中什么时候用that什么时候用who.which

主要看修饰的对象。that既可指人也可指物；who只能指人；which只能指物。

He is the man who/ that I saw yesterday.（who/that在从句中作宾语）

A friend who/ that helps you in time of need is a real friend . （who/that在从句中作主语）

### 1.只能用that作为定语从句的关系代词的情况 ：

1) 在不定代词,如：anything, nothing, everything, all, much, few, any, little等作先行词时,只用that. All that is needed is a supply of oil. 

2) 先行词有the only, the very, the just修饰时,只用that. He is the very man that helped the girl out of the water . 

3) 先行词为序数词(the last)、数词、形容词最高级时,只用that.. The first English book that I read was “The Prince and the Pauper” by Mark Twin . 

4) 先行词既有人,又有物时. He talked about the teachers and schools that he visited . 

5)当主句是以who 或which 开始的特殊疑问句时,用that 以避免重复. Who is the person that is standing at the gate . 

### 2,不能用that的情况，而用which/who：

#### 非限定性定语从句，逗号后面只能用which。
The sun heats the earth, which is very important to us. 
关系代词前有介词时. This is the hotel in which you will stay. 

####如有两个定语从句,其中一句的关系代词是that,另一句宜于用which. 
Let me show you the novel that I borrowed from the liberary which was newly open to us.
