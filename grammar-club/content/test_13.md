**Answer key 13**  

>  
1.(A)  
空格前后分别是完整的独立从句，中间只需要连接词，如A，把后面的从句
改为副词从句。B的as soon as possible已经是一个从句（as soon as it
is possible的简化)，不再是连接词。C和D都不是完整的连接词。  
2.(A)  
moreover是副词，不具连接词的语法功能，所以要用分号 (；)来取代连接
词。  
3 (B)  
四个答案在语法上都对，句意则只有B合理：“除非车子停稳了，否则下车不
安全。”  
4.(A)   
wait一词构成一个命令句，与右边的the price goes up之间要有连接词，
故可排除非连接词的B。答案D的that会把从句变成名词从句，不合词类要
求。C的for可以当连接词，不过要解释为because，在此不通，只有A这个
连接词是引导时间副词从句用的，符合要求。  
5.(C)  
now that解释为“既然”，符合原意。  
6.(B)  
上文有such，因而要有that来配合，表示因果关系。  
7.(A)  
句一和句二有相反关系，句二和句三有因果关系，因而分别用though和
so...that来连接。B中的by work hard错在以动词work直接放在介系词后
面。C中的he works hard with his dullness句意十分牵强。D与B相同，
也是错在把动词(work)直接放在介系词(with)后面。  
8.(C)  
had worked是过去完成式，could continue是过去简单式，这是时间先后顺
序，因而用before。  
9.(C)    
Though he was poor可改写为Poor as he was，注意连接词现在要用as。A
和D都是用介系词(despite和in spite of)来引导从句，属语法错误。B的
句型正确，但逻辑关系不通顺。  
10.(C)  
名词短语the typhoon warnings前面应有介系词（只有C是）。  
11.(D)  
空格中要表示“条件”，因而C不适合。A多一个动词，文法错误。B应该省
略掉与主语重复的me。D是以unless的副词从句表示条件，符合要求。  
12.(C)  
either和or之间的部分要和or之后的部分对称。符合条件的只有C(从句对
从句)，其余答案在词类上都不对称。  
13.(B)  
unwilling和had to 意思上相反，只有although可表示相反的关系。答案
B是although he was unwilling… 的简化。  
14.(B)  
not only和but also 亦要求对称。A虽然有对称，但是动词 was 和主语
three paintings 在单复数上有冲突，而C中应倒装的是not only was the
money stolen，不是后面的从句。  
15.(A)  
这个位置要用连接词，又要能当was的主语，所以要用关系代名词类（A或
B)。因为它前面没有先行词，不能用who，只能用what，故选A。what was going
to happen亦可作疑问句类的名词从句看待。  
16.(C)  
两个从句间已有连接词but,不能再用连接词（A、B和D 都是)，只剩下一个
副词类的C。  
17.(D)    
这个位置要用连接词。D是表示限度的从属连接词，符合要求。B的as many
as 则要配合复数名词才能使用。  
18.(D)  
这个位置要用连接词，故排除A。B会造成名词从句，不合句型要求。C和D
都是副词从句连接词，但只有D的lest(以免……）符合逻辑关系。   
19.(B)  
从下文的there be no contact…来看，是间接命令句语气，应为名词从句，
故选择B。  
20.(D)  
这个位置连接两个从句，要用连接词（A、C或D)，从意思判断用D较合理。
