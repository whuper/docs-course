**Answer key 15**  

>  
1. (C)  
not only必须有but also配合使用。  
2. (D)  
neither...nor之间要求对称。nor的右边是名词短语the imposition of a
totalitarianism (强加以集权统治)，最符合对称要求的是D中的名词短语
the devotion to militarism (奉献于军国主义)。  
3. (D)  
上文有not,可看出下文要有but，来表示：“并非前者，而是后者”。  
4. (A)  
对等连接词and要求对称。它前面的destructive和wasteful都是形容词，
所以后面也要选形容词（futile是“徒劳的”）。  
5. (B)  
either要和or配合使用，而且要求对称。  
6. (A)  
not only要与but also配合使用，而且要求对称。Not only后面是一个倒
装的从句，所以but后面也要选从句的构造，故选A。  
7. (D)  
空格前后分别是一个完整的句子，这两句话的内容有相反之处，所以要选表
示相反的对等连接词but。   
8. (B)    
对等连接词and要求对称。tall、handsome和intelligent都是形容词，可
以对称。  
9. (A)  
and右边用原形动词dance和左边的原形动词shop对称。  
10. (C)  
Not only移至句首时要用倒装句型。  
11. (A)  
and左边是名词the origin，右边也要求名词来对称，故选A。go指“围棋”，
源自日文。  
12. (D)  
同样是着眼于对称要求。只有D的pleasant beaches可以和 and 左边的
spectacular volcanoes 和 friendly people 对称。  
13. (D)  
未省略前是 the air is still，the humidity is high，and the air pressure
is low这三个以and连接的对等从句，省略掉重复的be动词之后即得出D。  
14. (A)  
nor置于句首时要用倒装句型。  
15. (B)  
and的右边有副词repeatedly，因而左边选副词carefully来对称。  
16. (C)  
形容词more reliable可和形容词more accurate对称。  
17. (C)  
比较级也要求对称。比较的一方是动名词短语controlling the way...,所
以在than后面与它比较的另一方应选C，trying to...也是动名词短语。  
18. (A)  
因为对等连接词and的要求，所以选名词happiness来和名词 harmony、
efficiency 对称。  
19. (C)    
not... but表示“非前者，是后者”。铅笔用的不是铅，是石墨。  
20. (C)  
下文有but also for…，所以空格中要选not only for...来配合。
