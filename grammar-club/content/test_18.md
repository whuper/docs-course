### 练习二

>  
1. (B)  
原为名词从句what you should do，简化为B。  
2. (C)  
原为They are treated with respect.，简化为C以维持被动态，并以动名
词形状置于介系词to之后。  
3. (B)  
lie (说谎）是不及物动词。“别人对我说谎”要这样表示： People lie to me.
改成被动态是： I am lied to (by people).这个句子再简化为动名词就是
being lied to。  
4. (B)  
原为 about the possibility that he will fail in the exam，简化为B。  
5. (A)  
原为名词从句that you must give me a call，简化为A。  
6. (A)  
原为名词从句that they will get married，简化为A。  
7. (B)  
选择不定词to say以求和前面的to say对称。两个to say都可视为名词
从句that you should say的简化。  
8. (A)  
原为名词从句that one cuts off all ties...，简化为A。  
9. (A)  
原来是像D中的句子，可是从句不能放在介系词on的后面，所以简化成A。  
因为在介系词后面，不能用不定词，所以助动词will可以忽略掉。  
10. (C)  
原为名词从句that I would be involved...,简化为C。
