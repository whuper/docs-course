**Answer key 3**

### 练习一

> 1.\(C\)  
> so far \(到目前为止）应用现在完成式，故排除过去式的B。主语是we，表  
> 示“我们听到”时应用主动态，故排除被动的 A。因空格后已有否定的  
> nothing,所以不选表示重复否定的 D。  
> 2.\(D\)  
> at present表“现在”，应用现在式，故排除未来式的B和C。主语road与  
> 动词build配合，应用被动态表示“被建造”，故排除主动的A。答案D表示  
> “现在正在被建造中”。  
> 3 .\(B\)  
> “现在它和三年前已大不相同”，可以看出，空格那个change要表示的是从  
> 三年前到现在的改变，因此选择现在完成式B。A和C其实也没错，表示它“经  
> 常在变”，不过这两个答案与题目第二句的呼应不及B密切。D的未来式则  
> 和题目第二句有较大的冲突。  
> 4.\(A\)  
> 从 when Anna phoned me以及I had just finished可看出时间在过去，  
> 因此表示现在时间的B和未来时间的D都可排除。又，空格前面有对等连接  
> 词and，要求对称。在A和C之中只有A是动词短语，可以和前面的动词短  
> 语had just finished对称。  
> 5.\(C\)  
> recently表示“不久前到现在”，应用现在完成式。表示“有”的观念应用  
> There is/are的句型，其现在完成式即是have been \(主语storms是复数）。  
> 6.\(D\)  
> 从future price \(未来价格）可看出时间在未来。主语price与动词determine  
> 配合应用被动态，这点从空格后面的by several factors亦可看出。唯一正  
> 确的被动态是D。  
> 7.\(B\)  
> 从at that time可看出时间在过去（19世纪）。因明确表示出那一段时间，  
> 应用过去简单式，故选B。  
> 8.\(C\)  
> 从主要从句was flooded可看出，淹水是过去时间，而造成淹水的原因“下  
> 雨”，只能在淹水之前发生，所以该用过去完成式。  
> 9.\(A\)  
> next Sunday 表示未来时间，故排除现在时间的D。然后介系词by表示  
> “到……为止”，应用完成式，因而排除简单式的B和C。  
> 10.\(C\)  
> 主语someone和动词smoke \(有人抽雪茄）配合应用主动态，故可排除被动  
> 的B和D。而A的would be smoking表示“将抽未抽”，如此则和we could smell  
> （已闻得到）有冲突，故选过去完成式的C，表示在那之前已有人在抽，才会  
> 留下味道。

### 练习二

> 1. have seen  
>    看过，而不说何时看的，应用现在完成式。  
> 2. went  
>    既说出看的时间\(last Monday\)，应用简单式。  
> 3. had seen  
>    时间是before you did，只知在过去时间you did之前，未明言在何时，应用过去完成式。如果用saw也不算错，因为在I saw和you did之间有before相连，清楚交待两个动作的先后，不必倚赖过去完成式来交待。  
> 4. saw  
>    因交待了“七八年前”，应用简单式。用had seen也不算错，这样的语气是“我看得比你早”，至于“七八年前看的”这点则在语气上不予强调。  
> 5. came  
>    因有the last time标出时间，应用简单式。  
> 6. wanted  
>    因为是回应Why did you...?  
> 7. guess  
>    这是这位小姐说话时的猜想，时间就是now，应用现在式。  
> 8. will see  
>    因为说出at 5:30的未来时间。  
> 9. will have started  
>    因为时间是by then，也就是“到了那个时候”，老早开打了。没说几点开打，总之在那之前，这就是完成式。也可用would have started，用would不是表示过去时间，而是表示假设语气，成为:“如果真的拖到七点才去的话，那就看不成了，非早点去不可!”这样的口吻。  
> 10. begin  
>     因为these evening games不只说今晚这场，而是“所有的
