**Answer key 9**  

>  
1. (B)  
这是间接命令句，应用命令语气，即原形动词。  
2. (D)  
这是过去时间(last night)的非事实，应用假设语气，即过去完成的形状，
故选D。  
3. (D)  
从下文might have won可看出这也是过去时间假设语气，应用过去完成形状：
If I had had the chance to participate …省略掉连接词If时需倒装，
故选D。  
4. (A)  
从上句was得知是过去时间（a close call意为千钧一发)，后面的假设语
气应用过去拼法的助动词配合完成式表示，故选 A。  
5. (C)  
从had asked可看出时间在过去，是假设语气，因而空格要选择过去时间假
设语气，故选C。  
6. (B)  
从上下文可看出这是间接命令句，应用原形动词，故选B。  
7. (A)  
从would have spoken可看出是过去时间假设语气，故应用过去完成拼法，
即If I had known him，省略If后要倒装，即是A。  
8. (C)  
wish表示这是非事实的愿望，要用假设语气。时间yesterday 是过去，其假
设语气应用过去完成式，故选C。  
9. (B)  
从would have made来看是过去时间的假设语气（本来当时可以演说的）。然
而下文的only that （不过）把语气反了过来，成为事实语气，所以要用简
单过去式B (he had a sore throat，他当时喉咙痛，这是事实，不用假设
语气。过去时间就是过去式)。  
10. (B)  
从even if和couldn't have helped可看出这又是过去时间的假设语气，应
用过去完成式，故选B。  
11. (A)  
由下文would have got可看出是过去时间假设语气，故应用过去完成式If
I had known，再省去If用倒装句，即是A。  
12. (B)  
原句意为“万一他要走了，一切都会完蛋。”因为句中用到假设语气，所以表
示他要走的可能性很小，这和B的语气近似（还好他不走，因为全靠他了。）
A是“他会走，不过也不用怕。” C是“事情会恶化，然后他才会一走了之。”
D是“我希望他不走，但恐怕他事情真的太多，不能留下来。”  
13. (B)  
由demanded that可看出这是间接命令句语气，应用原形动词。  
14. (D)  
A 中的they didn't stop是事实语气，it would have slowed them down (停
的话会太慢）是假设语气。B和A类似，只不过把停下改成不定词。C的much
as they would like表示 although they would like very much，而they
thought better of it是“他们打消了那个念头”。D的句型表示这是间接命
令句，可是动词却用stopped，不是原形动词stop，因而错误。  
15. (C)  
由上文If you don't finish可看出，不是假设非事实语气，而是还有可能
赶得完，用现在式来表示未来的可能情况，故下文要用未来式。  
16. (A)  
与上题相同，从I'll let you know可看出并非假设语气，所以要用现在式
来表示未来可能的情况。  
17. (D)  
dare可作助动词，不过当助动词就不能加-s，后面要接原形动词，例如He dare
not tell。这个词也可以作普通动词，不过当普通动词就不能直接加not作否定句，后面也不能再用原形动词，而应该如He doesn't dare to tell。  
18. (D)  
时间a week ago是过去，而语气助动词ought to要表示相对的过去时间得
用完成式来表示，故由A和D来选择。主词是door，动词是fix，应用被动
态，故选D。  
19. (C)  
“你竟然做出如此草率的举动，真让我想不到。”这是说事情已经做了！同样
的，助动词后面要加完成式来表示相对的过去时间，所以用C (这句要用主
动态)。  
20. (A)  
rather than就是一个比较级，than是连接词，前后连接的部分要对称。如
放在would之后，就会连接两个原形动词，故排除 D。答案 C 应为 would
prefer death to (disgrace)，答案 B应为would choose death over
(disgrace)，都是介词用错。
