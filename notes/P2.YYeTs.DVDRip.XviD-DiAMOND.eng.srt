1
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,270
Yes, sir. I redrafted the contracts

2
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,270
to include the new stipulations.

3
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,870
-then where are they? -i'm faxing the revisions now.

4
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,510
Did you make all the changes I asked for?

5
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,020
Yes. I included the four percent increase 

6
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,020
and the extra 2 million.

7
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,320
No, no. if it's a four percent increase 

8
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,320
then you have to add at least 3 million dollars.

9
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,790
No, that's not what I was told.

10
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,390
-who told you that? -their lawyers.

11
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,360
They're all idiots! 

12
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,360
I don't understand this total lack of communication.

13
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,700
It's okay. I just had no way of knowing, sir.

14
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,230
Look, this is what I need you to do.

15
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,700
-sir, could I put you on hold for a second? -okay.

16
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,940
-thanks. hi, jody. 

17
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,940
mr. harper wants to see you in his office.

18
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,610
-great. of course. -stlii want me to fax those?

19
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,820
You don't have to. I'm not even done yet. 

20
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,120
you should go home.

21
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,740
-are you sure? -Yes, it's late.

22
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,790
I don't want your parents to worry. get out of here.

23
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,350
okay. merry christmas, angela.

24
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,350
merry christmas, jody.

25
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,660
Hi, lorraine. of course I'm going to make it.

26
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,100
Just let me call you back. okay?

27
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,940
In a few minutes, I promise. okay.

28
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,640
Stlii on the morgan deal?

29
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,610
What can I do for you, jim?

30
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,650
I...

31
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,090
I don't know how to...

32
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,790
Angela, I feel terrible about what happened.

33
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,390
It's fine. let's just not worry about it, okay?

34
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,830
No, it's not okay. I acted like a real jerk.

35
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,310
I had too many drinks and... 

36
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,310
you know how these christmas parties can be.

37
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,210
We had a baby last year, and...

38
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,010
It's been a hard year.

39
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,450
I'm sure that it has.

40
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,850
I simpiy want to tell you that 

41
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,850
I'm really, really sorry. okay?

42
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,160
Apology accepted.

43
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,220
Thanks. merry christmas, angela.

44
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,990
You too, jim.

45
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,840
Lorraine.. you calling me from work? 

46
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,040
thought you were going home first.

47
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,910
-i brought everything with me. don't worry. 

48
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,910
man.. get over here, angie.

49
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,010
Lorraine.. god, I am so late with this dinner.

50
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,680
Did you pick up the santa claus costume?

51
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,680
I hope you didn't forget it.

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,660
I didn't forget it. It's in the car.

53
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,250
I think dad is more excited than the kids.

54
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,830
I can't wait to get out of here and see you guys.

55
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,160
Jimmy, put that back. we're having dinner soon.

56
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,460
you want santa to come tonight or not? 

57
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,460
rose.. mommy, I want santa to come.

58
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,560
Then help me set the table.

59
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,940
Okay, please don't be late. 

60
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,940
i won't. I promise. i won't

61
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,670
-okay, bye. -bye.

62
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,240
Okay.

63
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,720
-oh, jesus! -my god!

64
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,260
-sorry, angela... -it's okay.

65
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,530
I was just locking up the floors. 

66
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,030
I didn't know anybody would be working

67
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,760
This late on christmas eve.

68
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,670
-me neither. -sorry.

69
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,800
I'll come back later, all right?

70
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:17,840
Actually, if you wouldn't mind waiting, 

71
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,640
I'll lock my office

72
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,970
-and take the elevator down with you. -sure.

73
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,340
Two seconds.

74
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:25,970
Do you work all night?

75
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,810
Yeah, but they're closing the building

76
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,210
for the next three days.

77
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,980
-besides, I get new year's eve off. -that's good.

78
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,320
I hope to get home in time

79
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,320
for the girls to open up the presents.

80
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,550
-how are they? -great.

81
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,220
come on, your parents can't stand me. 

82
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,720
you're wrong. they love you.

83
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,260
so, where are you going this evening? 

84
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,260
i'm going to my sister's house in jersey.

85
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:49,670
I thought of you more as an upper east side girl.

86
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,700
Upper east side of maine, actually. I grew up on a farm.

87
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,340
A farm? Now, I'm having trouble believing that.

88
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,140
Hey, don't let the fancy clothes fool you. I keep it real.

89
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,740
Is that what you call it? keeping it real?

90
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,010
-goodnight, karl. -merry christmas, angela.

91
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:09,610
You too. I'll see you soon.

92
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,370
I promise you I'm leaving right now.

93
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,630
I know. I'm sorry, but I'm in the elevator.

94
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,700
Twenty-five minutes, tops.

95
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:34,270
I can't hear you. what? lorraine, you're breaking up.

96
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,680
Hello?

97
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,570
You have got to be kidding.

98
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,020
Come on.

99
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,520
Oh, god. what am I gonna do?

100
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,540
I'm getting out of the car is what I'm gonna do.

101
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,230
Oh, shit.

102
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,280
Hello?

103
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,540
Jesus!

104
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,790
Rocky, what are you doing? heel.

105
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,830
Stay. down.

106
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,430
-sorry about that. -it's okay.

107
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,700
Look, can you unlock the door to the elevator room?

108
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,070
My car won't start, and I need to get upstairs 

109
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,070
and get a cab.

110
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,230
Yeah, I can. I've just got to find my key cards.

111
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,910
Sorry. where are those darn keys? 

112
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:18,910
I'm about to do my rounds anyway, so...

113
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,570
-okay, great. -what happened to your car?

114
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,850
-i have no idea. -you probabiy left the lights on.

115
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,790
I don't think so. 

116
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,790
I'm usually pretty good about that kind of thing.

117
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,260
People do it all the time. it's instinctive. 

118
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,260
you drive down here, it's dark... it happens.

119
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,320
Here we go.

120
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,450
-great. -you know, actually...

121
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,760
I have a charger in the back

122
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,760
so if it is your battery probably you could use that.

123
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,700
Thank you, but... I really should just take a cab. 

124
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,700
I'm so late as it is.

125
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,570
No, no. it wouid probabiy take longer to get a cab. 

126
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,570
it's christmas eve.

127
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,500
So... I don't know. up to you. whatever you want.

128
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,480
how long will it take? 

129
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,480
just a few minutes. Give me one second

130
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,620
Now with beautiful metropolitan opera house

131
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,620
in the background,

132
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,530
Let's check out the temperatures in the tri-state area.

133
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:12,300
-which way to your car? -over there.

134
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,530
Okay.

135
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,540
Working late, huh? I know how you feel.

136
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,100
These are pretty reliable cars for the most part, right?

137
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,310
They're supposed to be.

138
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,780
All right. positive...

139
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,550
Negative.

140
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,030
-all right, try it. turn her over. -okay.

141
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,390
Strange.

142
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,090
Hang on. can you turn your headlights on?

143
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,260
Weird. try turning the keys again.

144
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:58,970
-damn it. -all right. I guess turn the headlights off.

145
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,370
You know what?

146
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:05,710
That's it. you've been a great help, but I give up.

147
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,850
Sorry. I don't know what happened. 

148
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,850
I thought I could do something.

149
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,450
You've been great. 

150
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,450
could you just let me in the elevator room now?

151
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,190
I was just trying to help.

152
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,770
I know. and I appreciate it. thank you.

153
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,440
Hey, I know you're upset about 

154
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,440
your car not starting, but...

155
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,510
It's the holidays. it's time to be thankful.

156
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,510
You know what? you're right.

157
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,180
-yeah? -i should be thankful.

158
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,590
I, uh...

159
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,990
I prepared a small christmas meal for myself.

160
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,530
You could join me if you want.

161
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:04,000
-i'm just kidding. -oh, sorry. I'm exhausted.

162
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,040
But thanks for your heip.

163
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,010
You're welcome. maybe some other time?

164
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,120
Sure.

165
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,220
All right.

166
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,390
Here you go. you sure you don't want me to call you a cab?

167
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,720
no. I've got a number in my bag. 

168
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,720
suit yourself. merry christmas.

169
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,990
Merry christmas.

170
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,410
karl?

171
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,840
Hi. can I get a car at 2370 park avenue, please?

172
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,540
Are you sure? no, that's okay. I'll wait. thanks.

173
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,690
Lorraine, you won't believe what happened.

174
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,690
no, my car wouldn't start.

175
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,760
Just start without me, and I'll be there within the hour

176
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,760
and I'll make it up to them.

177
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,940
Okay. I'll see you soon. bye.

178
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,460
Hello? oh, great. thank you thank you!

179
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,530
Okay. okay.

180
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,970
Oh, come on.

181
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,470
What?

182
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,720
This is not happening. is this a joke? 

183
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,720
god, no, you gotta be kidding me.

184
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,150
karl? where are you? is anybody here?

185
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,120
Come on, come on, come on.

186
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,070
What?

187
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,200
One second, okay? I'll be right back. just one second.

188
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,330
Hello, can you hear me?

189
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,490
I've got a cab waiting for me. 

190
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:46,490
can you open the front gate, please?

191
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,460
Hello?

192
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,700
No... wait!

193
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:58,310
No! damn it! why would you leave me here?

194
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,780
Wake up! the cab just left.

195
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,440
Hey! I'm still in here! wait!

196
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,690
Great.

197
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,970
It's okay.

198
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,480
Hello?

199
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,680
Okay, stop being paranoid.

200
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,960
Go down to the office.

201
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:03,230
Hello?

202
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,110
Oh, fuck!

203
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,870
Ho, ho, ho! merry christmas! 

204
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,870
you've been a good little girl.

205
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,540
Wait. it's okay. you're all right. okay?

206
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,850
All right?

207
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,560
You're not looking so good. are you okay? 

208
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,560
take it easy. it's okay.

209
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,430
what happened to me? what time is it? 

210
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,430
you just fell. you'll be all right.

211
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,100
I don't feel good. I'm going to be sick.

212
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,700
I'll get you some water.

213
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,410
Be careful! you're gonna hurt yourself. try to stay calm.

214
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,280
Okay.

215
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,320
It's okay. here. okay?

216
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:44,460
I'm going to help you up, okay?

217
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,160
Here we go.

218
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,060
There you go. it's okay.

219
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:55,910
All right. try to relax while I clean this up.

220
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,600
Okay.

221
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,980
Clean this up. okay.

222
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,590
All right. I'll be right back.

223
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:38,780
Hungry? I've got turkey,

224
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,750
Mashed potatoes, cranberries,

225
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,750
and I've even got some cornbread.

226
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:51,630
Oh, man. I'm sorry about this. I was just teasing.

227
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,660
I didn't mean to scare you.

228
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,400
I hope it's still warm.

229
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,870
If not, I have a microwave.

230
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,650
Are you feeling any better?

231
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,580
What happened to my clothes?

232
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,350
Like I said, you fell and your clothes got dirty...

233
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:29,330
Maybe you'd like some wine.

234
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:10,000


235
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:25,000


236
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,100
Help you relax a little bit, you know?

237
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,570
I don't know what you're doing, 

238
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,570
but you'd better just fucking untie me.

239
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,110
This is a california wine.

240
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,740
It's sonoma county. that's where I'm from.

241
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,420
It's beautiful up there.

242
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,520
Where are you from?

243
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:01,660
-what do you want? -i want to know where you're from.

244
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,700
I'm from readfield.

245
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,440
-readfield. where's that? -please, tell me what you want.

246
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,610
I just want to know where readfield is. 

247
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,610
and I want you to relax.

248
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,830
Cheers.

249
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:41,430
I'll make a toast. 

250
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,430
here's to good friends and hometowns

251
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,640
And readfield. wherever that is.

252
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,580
-listen... -tom.

253
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:55,850
Tom.

254
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:01,860
I have someplace to be. I have obligations.

255
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,060
Yeah. I know. way too many.

256
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,000
You need time for yourself. 

257
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,000
you don't need to be at everyone's beck and call.

258
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:17,770
Then maybe we should get a drink in the new year. 

259
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:25,010
I've already prepared everything. it's all here.

260
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:27,790
I know, and it looks really good.

261
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,480
Yeah? great. well, let's eat.

262
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,290
I'm starving.

263
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,300
Tom, this is really sweet of you, and I mean that.

264
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,850
But my whole family is expecting me. I have plans.

265
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,130
I guess some plans are made to be broken.

266
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,170
Do you want to say grace or should i?

267
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,610
Hell, let's skip it. I've never been religious anyway.

268
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,480
Bon appetit.

269
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,820
What do you like to do?

270
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,160
After work and stuff? I guess, hobbies.

271
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:17,100
That's a mundane question, but I guess people ask that

272
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:19,570
Just to get to know each other, right?

273
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,580
I read. right now I'm reading hemingway, 

274
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,580
the sun also rises.

275
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:30,410
And you really should eat. it's gonna get cold.

276
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,620
Anyway, in the book this guy loves this girl so much

277
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:41,190
That he's willing to forgive everything that she does.

278
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,430
Even her infidelities.

279
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,160
That's a pretty intense story, but...

280
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,100
That's what love is supposed to be, right?

281
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,310
My boyfriend is gonna get worried and come looking for me, tom.

282
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,790
If I don't show up, he'll come looking for me.

283
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,330
He knows where I work.

284
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,330
How long have you guys been dating or hanging out?

285
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,700
-two years. -two years?

286
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:30,870
do you live together? 

287
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,870
that's none of your fucking business.

288
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:37,250
That's not very nice dinner talk.

289
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,450
Yeah, we live together, okay?

290
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:47,690
Two years...

291
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,400
That's more than a boyfriend. 

292
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,400
that sounds like wedding bells.

293
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,530
Do you have any plans?

294
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:01,340
-yes. -what does your fiance do?

295
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,840
He's a journalist.

296
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,640
I knew he had to be smart. what kind of journalist?

297
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,110
-sports. -what paper?

298
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,320
-post. -i read the post.

299
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,620
-what's his name? -mark clayton.

300
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:18,750
Clayton. I don't remember that name.

301
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:25,860
-i have one over here. -it's online.it's the post online.

302
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,800
It's amazing

303
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,110
That you're able to keep a relationship 

304
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,110
with the amount of hours you work.

305
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,550
He must get really lonely

306
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,550
when you have to work late, right?

307
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,750
Do you love him?

308
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,750
Does he love you?

309
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,730
I'm only asking because I'm worried about 

310
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,730
how quickly he's going to get here.

311
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,700
I'm sure he's already on his way.

312
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:15,350
Right. he's probably on the harlem river drive as we speak.

313
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,650
-what kind of car does he drive? -i don't know.

314
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,880
You don't know what kind of car your fiance drives?

315
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,390
-toyota, I think. -toyota. that is a fast car.

316
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,530
He can be here a lot sooner than I was thinking.

317
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:31,120
He could be coming down this ramp right now.

318
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:44,070
You haven't been very talkative since we met.

319
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,770
But now you're telling me all about

320
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:55,510
Your boyfriend. oh, sorry, your fiance.

321
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,290
So either we've become best friends over dinner

322
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,290
or you're lying to me.

323
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,190
I'm guessing

324
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,790
You're lying to me.

325
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,740
You don't really have a boyfriend, do you?

326
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,300
But you want one.

327
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,780
You want somebody who cares about you...

328
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,110
-worries about you... -please, don't.

329
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,520
You've got a great family.

330
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,520
You've got lorraine.

331
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,920
Jimmy and rose. they love you.

332
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,160
They're probably getting worried about you.

333
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,400
Maybe we should give them a call. yeah?

334
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,300
Tell them you're okay.

335
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,170
What do you think?

336
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,590
What should we say?

337
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,200
I know. we should say you made other plans.

338
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,400
No. you probably already said that one.

339
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,870
You know what? you should think of something.

340
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:27,740
You're a good liar.

341
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:30,850
Go ahead.

342
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,150
Go!

343
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,010
No.

344
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,470
Hello? hello?

345
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:57,240
Hey, rosie. can you get your mommy on the phone?

346
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,970
Who's calling, please?

347
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,380
-it's auntie angie. -mommy, it's aunt angie.

348
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,540
Lorraine.. give me a second, okay? hey, where are you?

349
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,220
-angela? -i'm not feeling well.

350
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:14,120
What do you mean? we're all waiting for you.

351
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,880
She says she's not feeling well.

352
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,020
Man.. that's what she said the last time. 

353
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,020
lorraine.. can I talk to my sister, please?

354
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,460
Where are you, angie?

355
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,500
Mo ther.. she's got a real job. it's not like...

356
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,530
Lorraine.. angela?

357
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,640
I went home.

358
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,840
Mother.. what's wrong? where is she?

359
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,900
Lorraine.. I don't understand. last time I talked to you,

360
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,780
You were on your way. what about the costume?

361
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:39,880
Man.. let's just eat. you should know your sister by now.

362
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,450
Lorraine.. it would be nice if you'd try

363
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,390
And put your family ahead of your work sometimes.

364
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,320
Mo ther.. that's enough. give me the phone.

365
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,450
Angie, what's wrong?

366
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,060
Hello? I can't hear her.

367
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,020
Sweetie? can you hear me?

368
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,260
-hi, mom. I'm here. -honey, what happened? where are you?

369
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,810
I don't know.

370
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,070
I think it's the flu.

371
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,210
You really sound terrible. are you sure you're okay?

372
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,580
Yeah. I just need some rest.

373
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,980
Okay.

374
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,990
Rest up and hopefully 

375
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:20,990
you'll feel better for lunch tomorrow.

376
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,990
And don't worry about the costume, okay?

377
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,660
-merry christmas, angel. I love you. 

378
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,660
-i love you too, mom.

379
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,950
That was the best christmas present 

380
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:43,950
anyone's ever given me.

381
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,480
Thank you.

382
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,290
And now I have a present for you.

383
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,910
Go ahead.

384
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,470
Open it.

385
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:23,180
Aren't you even curious?

386
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,950
Come on Open it.

387
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,700
Yes.

388
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,270
Bet you're curious now.

389
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,940
Okay. enough torture.

390
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,010
Watch. it's all cued up.

391
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,790
-why are you showing this to me? -wait.

392
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,080
You fucked up now, asshole.

393
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,490
Sorry you had to see that.

394
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,500
You want to go for a stroll?

395
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,610
These guys always do whatever they want.

396
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,450
Here we go.

397
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,330
Rocky, sit down!

398
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,440
Why did you do that?

399
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,950
Rocky, shut the fuck up!

400
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,150
-let me help you up. -don't.

401
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,950
-don't touch me! -i'm not gonna hurt you. all right?

402
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,050
You're hurting my arm.

403
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,650
That's because you won't relax your arms. okay?

404
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,670
-come on. -just let me go. I won't tell anyone.

405
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,140
Yeah, I believe you. I just need to show you something.

406
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,050
Let's put that all behind us, yeah?

407
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,420
Here we go.

408
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,480
I think I drank too much wine.

409
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:38,980
I really shouldn't be driving.

410
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,950
I'm just kidding.

411
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:51,330
You know, I've seen you drive out of here so many times.

412
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,090
Strange being in the car with you.

413
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,560
It's great, actually.

414
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,030
-i thought you said we were taking a drive. -we are.

415
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,100
Then why are we going down, tom?

416
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:07,040
It's freezing out there.

417
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,280
Besides, this is gonna be much better.

418
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,590
Why are we down here, thomas?

419
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,220
Tom?

420
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,510
Oh, my god, tom.

421
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,420
What is this?

422
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:54,090
This is my present to you.

423
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,300
I want you to take this and show him.

424
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,130
Show him what?

425
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,440
Show him you're not a slut.

426
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,770
Take this and teach him 

427
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,770
he can't be touching every woman he wants.

428
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,080
Are you talking about what happened in the elevator?

429
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,030
Oh, tom, no. you don't understand. that was a mistake.

430
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,020
A stupid mistake.

431
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,570
-what? he tried to rape you. -no.

432
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,740
He got a little out of hand at a party, 

433
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,740
tom. he hardly tried to rape me.

434
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,570
Look, he was drunk. he apologized.

435
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,770
Oh, he apologized.

436
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,950
You think you're the first woman 

437
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:47,950
he tried to do this to?

438
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,540
I've seen him try to touch every woman in the building.

439
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:54,020
-he's a pervert. a degenerate. -no.

440
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,390
He's a good man, tom.

441
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,290
Look at him. he has a family. he has a wife. 

442
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,590
tom, please don't.

443
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,860
-Tom, tom... -stop calling out my name, all right?

444
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,490
I know what you're trying to do.

445
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,990
You're trying to humanize yourself, 

446
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,090
like you're some poor victim.

447
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:13,970
I told you, I'm not gonna hurt you! all right?

448
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,370
Stop calling out my name! enough's enough!

449
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,380
Tom, tom, tom! how many times can you say it?

450
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,210
Okay.

451
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,620
I know you're a person, okay?

452
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,760
I'm a person, too.

453
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:39,630
I know you have feelings. I have feelings, too.

454
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:43,270
I care about your feelings.

455
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,530
He's the one you should be scared of.

456
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,130
he's the one who has no feelings.

457
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,710
So if you want to help him,

458
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,340
Take this and teach him a lesson.

459
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,150
I told you, he apologized.

460
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,730
What? he can just apologize 

461
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,730
and then he can do it again?

462
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,660
And then he's just gonna apologize 

463
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,660
again and then...

464
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:13,060
You've got to stop letting 

465
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,060
these assholes have their way with you!

466
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,000
Tom, please believe me. 

467
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:19,000
it was just a misunderstanding, tom.

468
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:23,570
Tom, tom! just stop calling out my name! I told you!

469
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:27,500
-didn't i? -yes! yes.

470
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,640
i'm sorry, but you're scaring me. 

471
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,640
jesus! when are you gonna understand?

472
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:38,050
I'm here to help you. I'm not gonna hurt you.

473
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,030
Okay.

474
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,140
I'll do it.

475
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,310
You untie me and I'll do it.

476
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,460
No. oh, no. whoa.

477
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,150
You're a good person.

478
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,460
You're a good person, too.

479
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:19,290
I should have never asked you to do this. 

480
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,290
I'm sorry.

481
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:25,330
No. it's okay because I want to.

482
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,140
You just have to untie me and I'll do it for you.

483
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:42,880
No, no. it's my job to protect you.

484
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,820
No, tom, listen to me. it's not. 

485
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,820
please don't do anything.

486
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,950
Don't try to run away, okay?

487
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,430
Can I trust you?

488
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,490
-can I trust you? -yes.

489
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,330
You can trust me.

490
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,040
I'm sorry. oh god, I'm sorry.

491
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,440
So...

492
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,980
You like to touch girls, do you?

493
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,550
No? look at her.

494
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:20,050
I said look at her.

495
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,020
Does she look happy to you? huh?

496
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:29,690
Yeah.

497
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:32,960
You messed with the wrong girl.

498
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,970
What makes you think you deserve her? huh?

499
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,340
What gives you the right?

500
00:43:41,550 --> 00:43:43,880
You're something else, you know that?

501
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:48,550
You pretentious ivy league piece of shit.

502
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,210
You don't own the world and everyone in it.

503
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:54,190
What is a guy like you thinking 

504
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,790
when he puts his hands all over a girl

505
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:57,920
Who obviously is not interested? 

506
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,920
who is obviously not a slut?

507
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,230
Because that's what you think they are, right?

508
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah? I can't hear you. what did you say?

509
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:10,870
What? can you speak up?

510
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,670
Because you can't talk your way out of this one, can you?

511
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,470
-why am I even wasting my time with you? no!

512
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,350
-what? angela, he deserves it! 

513
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:24,350
don't do anything, thomas, please!

514
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:41,930
No!

515
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,480
Stop it! stop it!

516
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,730
Way to ruin christmas, asshole.

517
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:26,970
Well, he won't be bothering you again.

518
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:29,020
Where are we going?

519
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:32,880
We can't just leave him here. you have to get him.

520
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:35,150
What? why are you defending him?

521
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:37,690
I'm not. I'm not.

522
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,360
Do you like this? do you like to get touched?

523
00:45:40,430 --> 00:45:42,460
You like it when he touches you in the parking garage?

524
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,130
-do you want to get laid here? -you know that's not true.

525
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,640
So what is it? a career thing?

526
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,410
Did you fuck him to get a promotion?

527
00:45:53,950 --> 00:45:55,540
We can't leave him here.

528
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:02,080
You're right. I'm sorry.

529
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,750
We shouldn't leave him here.

530
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,330
Wait! thomas, stop!

531
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,360
what are you doing? 

532
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,360
we're gonna just take him for a little drive.

533
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:22,000
What are you doing? tom, stop the car! please!

534
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,300
Please stop! please!

535
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:28,880
Stop it! what are you doing, tom? no!

536
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:33,250
No! no!

537
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:36,850
Oh, my god!

538
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,490
No, please! oh, my god! don't do this.

539
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,700
Please don't! no!

540
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,170
Thomas, no.

541
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,610
You're a good person, thomas. please don't do this.

542
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,210
No! god, no! stop it!

543
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,420
Hey! hey!

544
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,520
Where are you going?

545
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,030
Angela! come back!

546
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,640
You fucked him, didn't you? liar!

547
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,900
Hey! down here!

548
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,360
Can you hear me? help!

549
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:05,310
Down here! can't you hear me?

550
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,060
Good boy.

551
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,810
Sit. good boy.

552
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,720
Stay right there, rocky.

553
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,780
Stay there.

554
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,280
Help me! help me, please!

555
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:10,190
Help me, please! someone's trying to kill me! help me!

556
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,600
Help me!

557
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,170
Somebody's trying to kill me!

558
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,530
Oh, karl. where are you?

559
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,000
Oh, my god.

560
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:26,200
Angela?

561
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,670
Please. if anyone can hear me...

562
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,540
I'm trapped in the underground parking 

563
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,540
structure of the arcadia building.

564
00:52:33,610 --> 00:52:36,100
It's 2370 park avenue.

565
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:37,710
Someone's trying to kill me.

566
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,080
Angela.

567
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,140
Angela, come out.

568
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,490
Shit.

569
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,560
Angela?

570
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:53,530
Can we talk about this?

571
00:52:59,270 --> 00:53:02,210
Looks like somebody's playing games, huh, rocky?

572
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,910
Angela?

573
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,710
Come on.

574
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:25,290
Come on. lobby. come on. lobby. come on.

575
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:27,460
Why is it fucking locked?

576
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:32,690
Angela!

577
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:41,100
Hello?

578
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:46,000
Hello? can anyone hear me?

579
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,070
Please, hello?

580
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:18,870
Answer, please?

581
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:23,110
Man.. yes? five brothers security here. hello?

582
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,990
Yes. I'm here. can you hear me?

583
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:31,650
I can hear you fine. how can I help you?

584
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:33,180
I'm being kidnapped. 

585
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,180
I work at brieter, smith and steinberg.

586
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,920
It's 2370 park avenue

587
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,330
And I'm hiding in the elevator. please can you call 911?

588
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,630
Calm down, miss. is there someone with you right now?

589
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,060
No, he's outside in the parking lot. 

590
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,060
he already killed someone else.

591
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:48,600
Did you see him do it?

592
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,010
Yes! his name is thomas 

593
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:52,010
and he's the parking attendant in my building.

594
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,310
If you'll just please hurry. I'm in danger.

595
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,410
Ma'am, you have got to relax and take a deep breath.

596
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,780
How do you fucking expect me to relax? 

597
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,780
this man is trying to kill me!

598
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:04,220
Can you please try to understand and call the cops?

599
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:07,310
Please just call 911 !

600
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:10,590
The police?

601
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:15,160
No. I'm sure he's just trying to help you.

602
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:18,700
Right?

603
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:21,160
Angela?

604
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:25,340
Are you still there?

605
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,540
Listen you fuck-face, I called the cops and I'm gonna stay down here

606
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,550
As long as it takes until they get here, 

607
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,550
so I suggest that you get the fuck out!

608
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:37,150
I just wanna talk to you.

609
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,490
That's why I pretended to be someone else,

610
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,490
okay? so don't be upset.

611
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,290
Will you come out? I was just kidding.

612
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:46,960
Just go to hell!

613
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,770
Don't you understand? I did it for you. 

614
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:52,770
that guy showed you no respect.

615
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:57,630
Why won't you talk to me, angela?

616
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,070
Just give me a chance.

617
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,020
If you just give us a chance, it can work out.

618
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,820
You'll grow to like me.

619
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,450
That's usually what happens when two people

620
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,890
Are forced to be together in a stressful situation.

621
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,560
They have to depend on one another. 

622
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,560
and eventually they support each other.

623
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:24,570
They like each other. sometimes they even fall in love.

624
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,470
Angela.

625
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,070
Please don't do this.

626
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:39,220
Why won't you talk to me?

627
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:45,150
You know, I wish you had just a little bit

628
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,150
more respect for yourself.

629
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:31,390
I'm not coming out! do you hear me?

630
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:35,630
I'm not fucking moving, you fuck!

631
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:33,480
Karl! oh, no, please.

632
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,940
Karl!

633
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,810
Come on, karl!

634
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,080
Angela?

635
01:01:40,490 --> 01:01:42,860
You must be freezing out here.

636
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:45,320
Angela.

637
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:58,570
What a mess.

638
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,010
Angela.

639
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:10,120
I think karl is hurt.

640
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,920
Angela? should we call him an ambulance?

641
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,770
That way he can go back to his kids and family, 

642
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:23,770
and you can go to your sister's.

643
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,590
And I could stay here! in this parking lot!

644
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:29,900
All by myself!

645
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:33,230
Because that's obviously what everybody wants!

646
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:38,940
Angela?

647
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:48,850
I just can't keep chasing you around all night.

648
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:54,320
Besides, the whole place is locked.

649
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,670
Angela?

650
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:03,600
Where are you gonna go if you get away?

651
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,240
It's freezing out there.

652
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,410
You can't go out.

653
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,280
Angela?

654
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,480
Angela!

655
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,350
Angela?

656
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:36,740
Way to ruin christmas, karl.

657
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:10,970
I'll have a blue

658
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,440
Christmas without you

659
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:22,410
I'll be so blue

660
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:27,450
Just thinking about you

661
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:34,460
Decorations of red

662
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,990
On a green christmas tree

663
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,700
Won't be the same, dear

664
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:49,110
If you're not here with me

665
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:53,180
And when those blue

666
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:58,120
Snowflakes start falling

667
01:04:59,690 --> 01:05:03,020
That's when those blue

668
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,950
Memories start calling

669
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:14,900
You'll be doing all right

670
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:20,000
With your christmas of white

671
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:25,270
But I'll have a blue

672
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,640
Blue, blue, blue christmas

673
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,980
You'll be doing all right

674
01:05:55,980 --> 01:05:59,780
With your christmas of white

675
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:05,090
But I'll have a blue

676
01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:08,250
Blue, blue, blue christmas

677
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:12,850
Thank you. thank you very much.

678
01:06:19,970 --> 01:06:21,500
Thomas.. oh, yeah.

679
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,180
Do you want makeup?

680
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,310
Okay.

681
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,560
You have the most beautiful lips

682
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:24,630
I have ever seen in my life.

683
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,930
You're beautiful.

684
01:07:30,170 --> 01:07:32,870
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

685
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,710
You have a wonderful body.

686
01:07:44,260 --> 01:07:47,520
It was meant to be, babe.

687
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:51,360
Me and you.

688
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:55,290
Your skin...

689
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:00,000
It's soft.

690
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:03,600
Honey.

691
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:09,410
I love you. angela, you know that, right?

692
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,490
Hello?

693
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:31,960
Shit.

694
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,730
I'm down here. hello? can you hear me?

695
01:08:40,680 --> 01:08:41,840
It's okay.

696
01:09:08,910 --> 01:09:10,500
Hello, officer. can I help you?

697
01:09:12,010 --> 01:09:13,840
Can you open up the gate, please?

698
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,940
Yes, sir. I'll be right up.

699
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:26,220
I'm sorry. I have to do this.

700
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:54,610
Hey.

701
01:09:56,220 --> 01:09:57,450
Sorry about that. 

702
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,450
I was on the bottom floor doing my rounds.

703
01:10:05,430 --> 01:10:06,620
What's going on tonight?

704
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:07,930
We got a call about a disturbance at this address. 

705
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,930
know anything about that?

706
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,470
No, it's been real quiet all night.

707
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,830
See anything, hear anything suspicious?

708
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:20,270
Like I said, I was just doing my rounds.

709
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:23,580
It's been really quiet. I haven't seen anybody down here.

710
01:10:23,650 --> 01:10:25,010
Any cars in there?

711
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:27,840
Well, it is a parking garage.

712
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:33,820
There's a few cars scattered over here in this level.

713
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:36,590
On the second level there's a rental thing.

714
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:38,820
Like I said, there's been no one around tonight. 

715
01:10:39,190 --> 01:10:40,820
except me and rocky.

716
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,800
Two of you working here tonight.

717
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:47,000
Kind of. he's my dog. he's down in the office right now.

718
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,770
We're gonna take a look around. 

719
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,770
get in the back. we'll give you a ride.

720
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,140
That's a great idea.

721
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:55,250
I've just gotta close this gate. 

722
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:58,250
a lot of homeless people around here.

723
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,750
Thanks for the ride.

724
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:46,590
If you guys wanna check out the other floors,

725
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,330
Just keep going around this way.

726
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,200
But be careful on p3. there's a broken water main, okay?

727
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:53,530
-we'll come back around. -okay.

728
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:04,230
What the hell's going on here, man?

729
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,390
Help me! help!

730
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:21,610
Help me! help!

731
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:36,960
Help me!

732
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,430
Sure you haven't seen anything weird tonight?

733
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:44,700
No. everybody left really early tonight.

734
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,210
You having a party in here?

735
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:49,870
No, no. it's just me and rocky, not a party.

736
01:14:54,650 --> 01:14:55,980
Got anybody coming over to visit? you know, 

737
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:57,980
a little action?

738
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,620
Me? no. the company would fire me 

739
01:15:00,060 --> 01:15:01,620
if I had anyone down here tonight.

740
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,390
Especially at this hour.

741
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:07,760
Well, we don't want to break any rules. right, partner?

742
01:15:08,330 --> 01:15:09,990
Not on my watch.

743
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:12,620
Come on, let's go.

744
01:15:16,010 --> 01:15:17,440
Help me!

745
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:20,740
Help me!

746
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:24,310
I've got to open the gate, so I'll just take the stairs.

747
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,080
Let's do it.

748
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,470
Open.

749
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,380
Wait!

750
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:17,430
You guys stay warm.

751
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:21,200
-you keep your eyes and ears open, huh? -you bet.

752
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:28,540
-merry christmas. -you too, buddy.

753
01:16:36,220 --> 01:16:38,950
Wait! wait!

754
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:47,100
Man.. 91 1.

755
01:19:47,180 --> 01:19:48,180
yes, please, I need your help. 

756
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:49,580
all our lines are busy at the moment.

757
01:19:49,650 --> 01:19:50,640
Please hold.

758
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:52,840
-someone will be with you shortly. -hello?

759
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:54,250
Thank you.

760
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:29,010
All our lines are busy at the moment. please hold.

761
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:36,120
91 1. all our lines are busy at the moment.

762
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:46,630
Rock? rocky!

763
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:02,490
Why would you do that?

764
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,290
He's just an animal.

765
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:11,660
Angela!

766
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,330
Why would you kill a defenseless animal?

767
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:30,910
After all I did for you? to help you?

768
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:34,410
This is what I get?

769
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,890
You killed my dog!

770
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:41,190
Answer. please answer.

771
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:42,720
Angela?

772
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:47,150
You're really starting to piss me off!

773
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,560
Angela!

774
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:40,350
Man.. hello? are you there?

775
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:43,710
Hello? this is the police. is somebody there?

776
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,150
Is this an emergency? 

777
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:49,150
if you can hear me, please say something.

778
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:53,030
Tap the phone, let me know if you're there. hello?

779
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:55,500
This is the police. this is 91 1. 

780
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,500
are you okay? are you there? hello?

781
01:23:04,870 --> 01:23:07,240
You're trying to get me fired, aren't you?

782
01:23:10,210 --> 01:23:12,240
Bet you'd really like that.

783
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:28,520
But, honey...

784
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:32,700
What are we gonna do then?

785
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:36,470
We couldn't just live off of your salary.

786
01:25:14,270 --> 01:25:15,460
Angela!

787
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:20,040
Angela!

788
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:26,140
Angela!

789
01:25:54,140 --> 01:25:55,840
Shit!

790
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:49,890
Shit!

791
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:03,900
Let's fucking do this. you want to fuck with me?

792
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:08,410
Come on!

793
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,420
Come on, you chicken shit!

794
01:29:35,130 --> 01:29:36,330
Angela?

795
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,690
Let me help you out, okay?

796
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,350
Help me? you're gonna help me?

797
01:29:57,420 --> 01:30:01,150
Why don't you let me help you, for a change? motherfucker!

798
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,250
What the fuck are you doing, Angela?

799
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:39,120
Come back here, now! let me go!

800
01:30:40,430 --> 01:30:43,520
Come over here and get me out of this right now!

801
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:47,570
Why are you doing this, angela?

802
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:50,730
Angela.

803
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:56,800
Angela? I just wanted us to be friends.

804
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:00,740
I'm alone.

805
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:03,810
I'm always alone.

806
01:31:07,090 --> 01:31:09,790
Why can't we just spend more time together?

807
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:14,890
Angela? wait.

808
01:31:16,030 --> 01:31:17,360
Why?

809
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:20,630
Why can't we be friends?

810
01:31:21,170 --> 01:31:25,070
Why can't we just spend christmas together?

811
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:29,040
Do you hear me? you stupid, fucking cunt!

812
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:44,050
Angela, wait. I didn't...

813
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:46,520
Merry christmas, thomas.

814
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:53,600
No! no! no!

815
01:31:54,170 --> 01:31:56,230
No! no!

816
01:33:54,360 --> 01:33:56,050
You all right, lady?
