### 打折

首先，最好的方法是用单词OFF，不用DISCOUNT  
比如：三折：70% off ，八折：20% off，九折：ten per cent off

打几折，就是100减掉几十的百分数，然后off。这是最正规的说法。

### 9折

I'll give you 10% off

This dress is now 10% off

This piece of clothes is at a discount of 10%

There is a 10% discount for this cloth.

This garment is 10% discount

This garment is on sell for 10 percent discount


#### DISCOUNT这个单词有名词，动词等用法。

* 这打几折?How much discount will you give me for it? (名词用法)  
* 八五折：at 15% discount (名词用法)(at换成with也可以)  
* 九七折：discount three percent (动词用法)  
* 七折：discount of 30% (名词用法)  
* 六折：make an allowance(reduction) of 40%(其他单词)
