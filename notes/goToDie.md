## Go die是否有语法错误 

The simple answer is the grammatical structure of some verbs is: “verb” + bare infinitive.


Infinitives are verbals (grammar words formed from verbs) used as nouns or modifiers (adverbs or adjectives) with the format of a marker “to” + verb in basic form. Examples: “To fight (noun) for your country is glorious” and “He intends to tough out (adverb) the bad times”


When infinitives are used with some verbs, the marker “to” is dropped. Infinitives with "to" dropped are called "bare infinitives".


For example: Let us see (with “to” dropped”) a movie./He must do (with “to” dropped”) it for me./I saw him steal (with “to” dropped”) a banana.
Now you should know what I am getting at. 


“Go” is one of those verbs which is followed by a bare infinitive. Therefore it is grammatically fine to say “Go die”, “Go figure”, “Go see a movie”, etc.


Similarly “come” can be followed by bare infinitive in appropriate situations. Therefore “Come join us”, and “Come play with me” are acceptable as well.

 

"Go die" and "Go kill yourself" are fine as well, i.e., grammatically but not morally.

 

To elaborate a little more:


Go die = Go (to) die.
a. The phrase “(to) die” is an adverbial infinitive telling the reason why you “go”.
b. The word “die” is a bare infinitive with the marker “to” being dropped.


Similarly, Come play = Come (to) play.
a. The phrase “(to) play” is an adverbial infinitive telling the reason why you “come”.
b. The word “come” is a bare infinitive with the marker “to” being dropped.

go fishing, go swimming...等中的-ing形式的属性在语法界颇有争议。

有人认为是动名词，是延用了古体英语go a-shopping, go a-swimming...的形式。

但在现代英语中，绝大多数的人都主张是现在分词作目的状语，这样更容易被人接受。




### 介词后面须加名词，构成介词短语

这也是介词唯一的用法

## 不及物动词是不后跟不定时的.
