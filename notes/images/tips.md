4. Teacher told us yesterday that the earth went around the sun.

老师昨天说地球围绕着太阳运转。

【请找出以上句子错误的地方】

【英文分析】Generally in complex sentences which include the object clause, if the predicate verb of main clause is in simple past tense, the predicate verb of subordinate clause should be also in past tense. However if the subordinate clause describes a fact or an objective truth, its predicate verb should be in the simple present tense.

【中文分析】习惯上在含有宾语从句的复合句中，主句的谓语动词用了一般过去时，从句的谓语动词要用过去的某种时态。但如果从句表述的是一客观事实或客观真理时，则不受主句时态的影响，而用一般现在时。

【正确用法】Teacher told us yesterday that the earth goes around the sun.

5. It has been a long time since I met you last.

好久不见了。

【请找出以上句子错误的地方】

【英文分析】The word “since” is usually the symbol of present perfect tense. But in some sentences like above whose main clause emphasizes a period of time, we use simple present tense to replace present perfect tense.

【中文分析】“自从......已经有多长时间”，这类句子当中，主句通常用一般现在时代替现在完成时。

【正确用法】It’s a long time since I met you last.

6. I have studied English for three years since I had come here.

从我来到这儿学英语已经有3年了。

【请找出以上句子错误的地方】

【英文分析】“Since” means the beginning time of the action in the main clause, so the subordinate clause behind it should be in the past tense, not the perfect tense.

【中文分析】since用来表达主句动作的开始时间，所以其引出的从句中应为过去时，而不能用完成时态。

【正确用法】I have studied English for three years since I came here.

7. I’ll go hiking if it won’t rain next Sunday.

如果下周末不下雨的话我就去远足。

【请找出以上句子错误的地方】

【英文分析】In complex sentences including adverbial clause of time or adverbial clause of condition, if the predicate verb of the main clause is in simple future tense, the predicate verb of the subordinate clause should be in simple present tense.

【中文分析】习惯上在含有时间状语从句和条件状语从句的复合句中，如果主句的谓语动词用了一般将来时，从句的谓语动词要用一般现在时表示将来的动作。

【正确用法】I’ll go hiking if it doesn’t rain next Sunday.

8. They had supper when I went to see them.

我去看他们的时候他们在吃晚餐。

【请找出以上句子错误的地方】

【英文分析】“Have lunch” is a continuous action, it is on-going, someone was eating at that time when I just arrived or when I knocked on the door. So we should use the past continuous tense.

【中文分析】他们在吃晚餐是在过去我去看他们的时间某一点上正进行的动作，应用过去进行时。

【正确用法】They were having supper when I went to see them.

9. She went to Australia two months ago. She has been there many years before.

她两个月前去澳洲了，她许多年前到过那里。

【请找出以上句子错误的地方】

【英文分析】We don’t count “many years before” from right now back to the past, we count it from the past (a moment from two months ago) back to the further past. That’s why we use past perfect tense.

【中文分析】many years before是从过去的某时之前算起的，表示过去的过去，要和过去完成时连用。

【正确用法】She went to Australia two months ago. She had been there many years before.

10. I learned that her father had died in 1950.

我得知她的父亲于1950年去世了。

【请找出以上句子错误的地方】

【英文分析】The action of the predicate verb of the subordinate clause happens earlier than that of the main clause, but we have an adverbial of time “in 1950”in the subordinate clause, so we use the simple past tense instead of the past perfect tense.

【中文分析】从句中的谓语动词动作虽然发生在主句谓语动词的动作之前，但因从句中有明确的过去时间状语in 1950, 所以不用过去完成时态，而用一般过去时态。

【正确用法】I learned that her father died in 1950.
